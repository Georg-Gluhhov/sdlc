            The waterfall model is one of the best known and oldest software development methods, named after the analogy of successive waterfalls - water falls from one level to the next and does not return. Some of the industries that regularly use the waterfall model include construction, IT and software development. As an example, the waterfall software development life cycle, or waterfall SDLC, is widely used to manage software engineering projects. Waterfall model used in 
            Development of Department Of Defense (DOD), military and aircraft programs followed Waterfall model in many organizations.
            This is because of the strict standards and requirements that have to be followed.
            In such industries, the requirements are known well in advance and contracts are very specific about the deliverable of the project.
            DOD Agencies typically considered Waterfall model to be compatible with their acquisition process and rigorous oversight process required by the government.

                The iterative model is a particular implementation of a software development life cycle (SDLC) that focuses on an initial, simplified implementation, which then progressively gains more complexity and a broader feature set until the final system is complete. An example of iterative and incremental development in Agile could be the creation of a new e-commerce website. The project would be broken down into smaller increments, such as building a wireframe, uploading products, and creating advertising copy.

                    Prototype model should be used when the desired system needs to have a lot of interaction with the end users. Typically, online systems, web interfaces have a very high amount of interaction with end users, are best suited for Prototype model.For example, engineers may complete a working model prototype to test a product before it is approved for manufacturing.

                        The spiral model is a systems development lifecycle (SDLC) method used for risk management that combines the iterative development process model with elements of the Waterfall model. The spiral model is used by software engineers and is favored for large, expensive and complicated projects.The best-suited example for the spiral model is MS-Excel because MS-Excel sheet having several cells, which are the components of an excel sheet. Since we have to create the cells first (module P), then we can perform operation on the cells like split cells into half (module Q), merge cells into two, and then we can draw graphs on the excel-sheet (module R).

                            V-Model is used for small projects where project requirements are clear. Simple and easy to understand and use. This model focuses on verification and validation activities early in the life cycle thereby enhancing the probability of building an error-free and good quality product.A good example of the V-model used in the automotive software realm is the ECU development process as outlined by D-Space 10 (Fig. 4). In the automotive industry, it is common to test how a specific module of a system will function when possibly a number of the other components of the system (both hardware and software) have not been built yet.

                                Agile project management methodology is commonly used for software development projects. It has greater adaptability to frequently changing scope. As a consequence, agile project management uses iterative or phased planning and continuous integration throughout the life of the project. The most popular and common examples are Scrum, eXtreme Programming (XP), Feature Driven Development (FDD), Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), Adaptive Software Development (ASD), Crystal, and Lean Software Development (LSD). Teams generally pick one or two methods. The most widely used methodologies are Scrum and XP, which dovetail nicely.
